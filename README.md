description: TokenBridge provides data and token transfer capabilities across EVM chains
---

# Welcome

The TokenBridge allows users to transfer data \(e.g. digital asset ownership information\) between two chains in the Ethereum ecosystem. Cross-chain bridges provide fast and secure connections between blockchains, creating scalability and connection - interoperability - between Ethereum networks. 

TokenBridge operates in [**several modes**](about-tokenbridge/features/) depending on the network requirements. A simple UI allows any user to bridge assets to and from active chains.

## **Production asset-transfer bridges**

The following bridges are fully-functional in production environments:

* \*\*\*\*[**POA Bridge**](https://bridge.poa.net/) \(POA network to Eth Mainnet\):The POA Bridge was the first EVM cross-chain production bridge in existence.
* \*\*\*\*[**xDai Bridge**](https://dai-bridge.poa.network/) \(Eth Mainnet to xDai Network\): The xDai chain uses the ERC20-to-Native TokenBridge functionality to provide fast, inexpensive and stable transactions.
* \*\*\*\*[**Eth Classic Bridge**](https://wetc-app.herokuapp.com/) \(Eth Classic to Eth Mainnet\): The Eth Classic Bridge connects ETC to ETH, where ETC is available as WETC.

Additional bridges in development include the [**Arbitrary Message Bridge**](amb-bridge/about-amb-bridge.md) \(AMB\) and the [**Binance Bridge**](eth-bnc-bridge/about-eth-bnc-bridge.md) \(ETH - BNC\) which are actively running  in test environments.
