description: TokenBridge provides data transfer capabilities across EVM chains
---

# Welcome

The TokenBridge allows users to transfer data \(e.g. digital asset ownership information\) between two chains in the Ethereum ecosystem. Cross-chain bridges provide fast and secure connections between blockchains, creating scalability and connection - interoperability - between Ethereum networks. 

TokenBridge operates in [several modes](about-tokenbridge/features/) depending on the network requirements. A simple UI allows any user to bridge assets to and from active chains.

**Production asset-transfer bridges include:**

* [POA Bridge](https://bridge.poa.net/) \(POA network to Eth Mainnet\)
* [xDai Bridge](https://dai-bridge.poa.network/) \(Eth Mainnet to xDai Network\)
* [Eth Classic Bridge](https://wetc.app/) \(Eth Classic to Eth Mainnet\)

Additional bridges including the [Arbitrary Message Bridge](amb-bridge/about-amb-bridge.md) \(AMB\) and the [Binance Bridge](eth-bnc-bridge/about-eth-bnc-bridge.md) \(ETH - BNC\) are active and fully-functional in test environments.
