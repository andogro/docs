description: TokenBridge allows asset transfer between EVM chains
---

# Welcome

The TokenBridge allows users to transfer assets between two chains in the Ethereum ecosystem. Digital assets \(either coins or tokens, depending on the bridge mode\) are locked in one network and representative assets \(coins/tokens\) are minted in another. When the process is reversed, the representative assets are burned on the network where they were minted, and the locked assets are released.

Cross-chain bridges provide the potential for scalability and connection - interoperability - between previously siloed Ethereum networks.
