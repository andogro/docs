# Using the qDai Bridge

It is possible to use several ways to transfer DAI tokens to the qDai chain and back. This section will cover two of them:

* Exchange tokens by using a UI based on BurnerWallet 2
* Exchange tokens by using Etherscan and Blockscout

Both approaches assume that the MetaMask browser extension is configured to support the qDai JSON RPC endpoint.
