# Using the qDai Bridge

It is possible to use several ways to transfer DAI tokens to the qDai chain and back. This section will cover two of them:

* [Exchange tokens by using a UI based on BurnerWallet 2](https://docs.tokenbridge.net/eth-qdai-bridge/qdai-bridge-extension/using-the-qdai-bridge/transfer-dai-with-ui)
* [Exchange tokens by using Etherscan and Blockscout](https://docs.tokenbridge.net/eth-qdai-bridge/qdai-bridge-extension/using-the-qdai-bridge/transfer-dai-without-ui)

Both approaches assume that [the MetaMask browser extension is configured](https://docs.tokenbridge.net/eth-qdai-bridge/qdai-bridge-extension/using-the-qdai-bridge/configuring-metamask) to support the qDai JSON RPC endpoint.
