# UI to transfer tokens

There is no an uniformed UI to allow user to transfer tokens through the AMB multi-token extension yet. 

But the tokens owner could easily develop an application without knowing any programming languages by using [solUI](https://solui.dev/).

Here is an example of the application to transfer JOON tokens from the Ethereum Mainnet to the xDai chain and back: [https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmcMZEEZX7GF4d82AYvX8CsoNQh5v9vPZfs7CdK7s8XkzV/\#l=./dapp-e145213f89.json](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmcMZEEZX7GF4d82AYvX8CsoNQh5v9vPZfs7CdK7s8XkzV/#l=./dapp-e145213f89.json).
