# About the xDai Bridge

* **Bridge Type:** ERC20 to Native, where Dai on the Ethereum mainnet is locked and xDai is minted on the xDai Chain.
* **UI Location:** [https://dai-bridge.poa.network/](https://dai-bridge.poa.network/)

The xDai chain uses the ERC20 to Native TokenBridge functionality to provide fast, inexpensive and stable transactions. This bridge allows users to transform DAI \(an ERC20 stable token\) on the mainnet into xDAI on a compatible chain. xDAI tokens can then be sent quickly and with minimal cost on the xDAI network. The xDAI chain has been a breakout success in the Ethereum community, providing an easy way for vendors to accept a stable cryptocurrency.
