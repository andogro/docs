### Transfer  Dai from the Ethereum Mainnet to the xDai Chain

* Make a usual transfer of DAI tokens \(`0x89d24A6b4CcB1B6fAA2625fE562bDD9a23260359`\) on the ETH Mainnet by any software that is able to do ERC20 transfers \(e.g. [NiftyWallet ](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nifty-wallet/jbdaocneiiinmjbjlgalhcelgbejmnid?hl=en), [MyEtherWallet.com](http://myetherwallet.com/), [TrustWallet](https://trustwallet.com/)\). Use the Token Bridge address `0x4aa42145Aa6Ebf72e164C9bBC74fbD3788045016` as the recipient of the payment.
* Wait for the transaction confirmation in the ETH Mainnet \(depends on the gas price you setup for the transfer transaction and the network throughput\).
* Wait for the relay confirmation by the bridge validators \(depends on the number of blocks that the bridge validators wait for to consider the chain finalized, for now it is `8`\).
* Check your balance on the xDai chain
